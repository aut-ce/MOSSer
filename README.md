## Introduction
A bash script to make [MOSS](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) usable in Amirkabir University of Tech.

The project delivery process is critical in academic environments. First of all, we recommended you to use the [Quera](https://quera.ir/dashboard/) website for project submission and provide the website with your students' identification. Then before the project delivery deadline, use this repository to detect the students who cheat from each other.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AUT-CEIT/MOSSer.git
```

2. Download student submissions from the Query based on their student ID and extract it under the `input` directory.
3. Run the script and find the cheaters :joy:

```sh
./run.sh
```
